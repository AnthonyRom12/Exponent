# Exponent in C++
In this programm we assign integer variable __n__, whose value determines the index of the last summand in sum (and less on 1 than quantity summand).
In Variable __x__ we assign value of exponent argument. Also we assign 3 additional variables. 

For calculasion of sum we using __Do{} While()__ statement loop. In body of statement by the command __s += q__ the value of the additive is added to the sum.
Next step: increment __k++__ increase value of index variable, after all by the command __q *= x / k__ the additive value for the next iteration is calculated.
Statement is working untill condition is __True__
